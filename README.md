## About Code

Austen Ipsum uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). For this particular project, I wanted to familiarize myself with Redux Toolkit. Of course, using Redux is a smidge superfluous for a project as small as this but seeing as I was just starting out, I thought it would be a great way to familiarize myself with Redux without getting too scrambled.

Other npm packages this webapp use:

- Sass (CSS)
- EmailJS (contact form)
- FontAwesome (icons)
- copy-text-to-clipboard

In addition to Austen Ipsum, I also created a [JSON generator](https://github.com/louvang/json-austen) for the paragraphs of texts from Jane Austen's novels. I wanted to make sure the generator didn't add large, exhaustive paragraphs that aren't practical as placeholder text for designers and developers.
